    "### **Understanding the DeepSeek R1 Paper**\n",
    "This chapter is a crash course paper reading. We will walk through the paper in simple terms, and then we will break down the key concepts and takeaways.\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSeek R1 represents a significant advancement in language model training, particularly in developing reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning. The paper introduces a new reinforcement learning algorithm called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most remarkable discoveries in R1-Zero’s training was the emergence of a phenomenon known as the “Aha Moment.” This phenomenon is somewhat similar to how humans experience sudden realizations while problem-solving. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial Attempt: The model makes an initial attempt at solving a problem\n",
    "2. Recognition: It recognizes potential errors or inconsistencies\n",
    "3. Self-Correction: It adjusts its approach based on this recognition\n",
    "4. Explanation: It can explain why the new approach is better"
