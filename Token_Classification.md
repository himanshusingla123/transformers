Good question 👍 Let’s unpack that.

This sentence is describing how **NER (Named Entity Recognition)** labels are applied when you have **subword tokenization** (like BERT’s WordPiece or GPT’s BPE).

---

## 🔹 Background

In **NER tagging**, we use the **BIO scheme**:

* **B-XXX** → Beginning of an entity of type `XXX` (e.g., `B-PER` = beginning of a person’s name).
* **I-XXX** → Inside an entity of type `XXX`.
* **O** → Outside (not part of any entity).

Example (word-level):

```
[ Barack ]   [ Obama ]  was born in [ Hawaii ] .
  B-PER        I-PER                     B-LOC
```

---

## 🔹 Problem with subword tokenization

Modern models (like BERT) don’t tokenize only by words.
Example: "Washington" might split into:

```
["Wash", "##ing", "##ton"]
```

If the whole word "Washington" is tagged as a location (`B-LOC`), we must decide what to do with its subword pieces.

---

## 🔹 The rule you mentioned

👉 “For tokens inside a word but not at the beginning, we replace the B- with I- (since the token does not begin the entity).”

That means:

* The **first subword** gets the original tag (e.g., `B-LOC`).
* The **following subwords** get converted to `I-LOC`, because they’re still inside the same entity, but not the beginning.

---

## 🔹 Example

Word-level label:

```
Washington  → B-LOC
```

Tokenized (WordPiece):

```
["Wash", "##ing", "##ton"]
```

Final labels after applying the rule:

```
["Wash" → B-LOC,
 "##ing" → I-LOC,
 "##ton" → I-LOC]
```

So the "I-" is basically used to **extend the entity span across subword tokens**.

---

Whenever a word is split into multiple tokens, only the **first token keeps the "beginning" tag (B-)**, and the **rest are relabeled as "inside" (I-)** so the model still understands they belong to the same entity.

---

### 🔹 The context

When training NER with Hugging Face tokenizers:

* You have **word-level labels** (e.g., `"Washington" → B-LOC`).
* But the tokenizer splits words into **subword tokens** (`["Wash", "##ing", "##ton"]`).
* You must **expand the labels** so each token has a label.

---

### 🔹 The code

```python
label = labels[word_id]
# If the label is B-XXX we change it to I-XXX
if label % 2 == 1:
    label += 1
new_labels.append(label)
```

#### What’s happening?

1. `labels[word_id]`

   * Gets the label for the **word** corresponding to the current token.
   * Example: `labels = [B-LOC, O, B-PER, ...]`.

2. `if label % 2 == 1:`

   * Hugging Face often encodes labels as **integers** instead of strings.
   * Example:

     ```
     0 = O
     1 = B-PER
     2 = I-PER
     3 = B-LOC
     4 = I-LOC
     ...
     ```
   * Notice: **B- tags are odd numbers** (1, 3, 5, …) and **I- tags are even numbers** (2, 4, 6, …).

3. `label += 1`

   * If the current token is **not the first subword of the word** → convert `B-XXX` → `I-XXX`.
   * Example:

     * Original: `B-LOC = 3`
     * Convert: `I-LOC = 4`

4. `new_labels.append(label)`

   * Save the adjusted label for this token.

---

### 🔹 Example in action

Word-level annotation:

```
Washington → B-LOC
```

Tokenized:

```
["Wash", "##ing", "##ton"]
```

Processing:

* First subword `"Wash"` keeps `B-LOC (3)`.
* Next subword `"##ing"`: code changes `3 → 4` (`I-LOC`).
* Last subword `"##ton"`: again becomes `I-LOC (4)`.

Resulting labels:

```
["Wash" → B-LOC, "##ing" → I-LOC, "##ton" → I-LOC]
```

---

✅ **Need of this code**:
Without it, every subword of an entity would incorrectly be tagged as a beginning (`B-XXX`). This would confuse the model, because it would think `"Washington"` is three separate locations. The fix ensures only the first token is `B-`, and the rest are `I-`.
